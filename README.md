# Caesar Cipher

## Overview

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also referred to as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, stands as one of the simplest and most renowned encryption techniques. This method is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is substituted with a letter positioned a fixed number of places down the alphabet. For instance, with a left shift of 3, the letter D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so forth. This technique is named after Julius Caesar, who employed it in his private correspondence.

To decipher the text, the process is reversed using a right shift of 3.

## Program Details

This program was developed incrementally by breaking it down into small, manageable tasks, each identified in the accompanying flow chart.

### Features

The user can choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
The user inputs the cipher key for the operation.
After completing an operation, the program will prompt the user to determine if they want to perform another encryption or decryption.

### Dependencies

The program requires the art.py module, which provides the necessary ASCII art for the program to run correctly. Ensure this module is in the repository.

### Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Choose to either encrypt or decrypt a message.
3. Enter the cipher key.
4. The program will perform the desired operation and display the result.
5. Optionally, choose to perform another operation or exit.

This program encapsulates the Caesar cipher's simplicity and historical significance while providing an easy-to-use interface for encryption and decryption tasks.
